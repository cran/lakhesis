Description: Determining consensus seriations for binary incidence matrices, using a two-step process of Procrustes-fit correspondence analysis for heuristic selection of partial seriations and iterative regression to establish a single consensus. Contains the Lakhesis Calculator, a graphical platform for identifying seriated sequences. Collins-Elliott (2024) <https://volweb.utk.edu/~scolli46/sceLakhesis.pdf>.
